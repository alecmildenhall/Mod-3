Friendly Hugging Robot

We were assigned to create a creative embedded sculpture with at least 4 motors, so we decided to make a hugging robot. With the end of the semester coming up, and a lot of stressors, we thought that everyone could use a hug from a friendly robot.

Materials Used:
- ESP32 TTGO T-Display
- USB compatible with computer
- 2 Servo Motors
- 2 Stepper Motors
- 1 breadboard
- Cardboard box
- Construction Paper
- Chopsticks
- Sharpie
- Tape

We connected the eyebrows to two servo motors and the arms to two stepper motors. To make sure that the servo motors work in unison and that the stepper motors work in unison, the two servo motors share code and the two stepper motors share code. Therefore, to achieve the hugging motion, we had to orient the motors themselves two different ways. We used a laptop as the power source, as the sculpture was not meant to be moved around so therefore did not have to be wireless.
